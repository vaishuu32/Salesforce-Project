# Salesforce-Project
FoodConnect is a Salesforce-based initiative aimed at addressing food insecurity by streamlining the process of redistributing leftover food to underserved communities. This repository contains all necessary resources, setup instructions, and documentation to help developers, NGOs, and volunteers implement this project effectively.
